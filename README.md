This is Eric,
Outside the basic names (HTML CSS Javascript Python) I'm pretty unaware of most things that do with code. I'm a linguist. I speak Japanese Spanish and English.  I want to be apart of the new job world that's opening up to create technology that's capable of doing real-life translation.
